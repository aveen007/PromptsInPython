Compared to the 4.16 and 0.11 seconds that we got when implementing the methods using an array.\n",

    "### underlying reasons for the results recieved\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using deque to implement the circular buffer is the more natural approach for the following reasons:\n",
    "Operations in deque are of complexity O(1), due to it's two pointer implementation with one pointer at the end and the other one on the front of the queue. In this use case we only need the push and pop operations since we are not concerned with the get element at a certain index method, which in either way matches the complexity of it being implemented with an array and that is O(n). \n",
    "on the other hand, implementing the methods using the simple array approach gives a O(n) time complexity in the case of a full buffer and that is because of the need to insert an element at a certain index. \n",
